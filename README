What is kdeplayground?
----------------------

The kdeplayground modules contain software that is under development but
that has not reached a stable state. Some software present has only been
developed as a proof of concept and will not see further development.
Due to the experimental nature of the software, most of the software in
the kdeplayground packages has not received the same level of scrutiny
as the software in other modules.

Although the software in the kdeplayground modules is publicly available
for the purpose of its ongoing development, it should not be considered
released, supported in any way or fit for any purpose.

Using kdeplayground
-------------------

The modules use the standard autoconf/automake based KDE build system. To
add a new module to the build, create a subdirectory with your code and then
say "make -f Makefile.cvs".

Don't forget to add your new subdirectory to the INDEX file.
