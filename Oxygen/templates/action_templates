ACTION TEMPLATES

Goal: perfect looking 32x32 action
document size: 128x128 px. 

Goal: perfect looking 22x22 action
document size: 88x88 px.

In both cases ratio is 4:1, which mean every 4 pixel will look as 1 in the 
final icon.
You should keep open kcalc and try to make objects boundaries dividable for 4.
Also it's important to place objects in dividable for 4 coordinates.

PS: Focus only on 22x22 and 32x32 icons, that's already a lot of work, hopefully we'll get rid of 16x16 and 48x48 ;p
