All files associated with the Oxygen theme are to be considered an incomplete, a work in progress which has not been officialy released in any way. Oxygen is an icon theme for KDE4. Hopefully it will be "the" icon theme for KDE4. Nobody should pacakge Oxygen and/or make it available in any form anywhere, except in the KDE svn repository "svn.kde.org/home/kde/playground/artwork/Oxygen/" until we feel it is ready to be released. Check the website (http://oxygen-icons.org) for screenshots, previews, and more information.

Status: As of Sunday, June 4th, 2006 the website is not updated to match the current state yet but stay tuned, we are working on it :-)
