This is a list of icons that are needed by KDevelop that are applicable to at
least IDE's in general (some have even wider application than that, e.g. the
sync-to-current-folder icon which is also used by at least Kate).

I don't know how many are 'on the list' already, but I didn't see the compile
group, so I'm guessing most of these are 'new'.

NOTE: items with '?' are lower priority (things that don't currently have icons
and may not need them). IMO 'sync to folder' and 'find in files' should have
highest priority since these are most likely to have wider use (also the sync
icon in KDE 3.5 is terrible :-)).

In fact, don't start on any of the '?' items yet, they may or may not go away
for KDevelop 4.

- build icons
	- 'build'
		builds the project (like 'make')
		ideas: window with fat down arrow at the lower center or lower right
	- 'build active'
		builds the 'active target' ('$ make <target>')
	? 'compile'
		compiles a single file
		ideas: like 'build' but with a file instead of a window
	- 'clean'
		deletes built files ('$ make clean')
		ideas: broom, broom over window/files
	? 'distclean'
		deletes maintainer-generated files, like 'configure' ('$ make distclean')
		ideas: broom over a gear/wrench
	? 'configure'
		ideas: like 'build' but with a gear/wrench also
	? 'run autotools'
		ideas: like 'configure'?
	? 'install'
	? 'install as root'
	? 'make messages'
		builds files for i18n
		ideas: like 'build' but also with pen/feather/stylus
- debug icons
	- 'run', 'break', 'stop'
		...listed for completion (will use VCR 'play', 'pause', 'stop' resp.)
	? 'restart'
		ideas: use VCR-style restart; play after a bar? what is VCR restart?
	? 'resume'
		opposite of 'pause' (i.e. 'not restart')
		ideas: pause with circle+slash
	- 'run to cursor'
		continues execution until execution reaches the line where the cursor is
		ideas: VCR-style forward (play pointing to bar)?
	- 'step'
		executes one line of code, then stops
	- 'step instruction'
		executes exactly one machine instruction, then stops
	- 'step out'
		completes execution of the current function, stopping when the function
		returns
	- 'step over'
	- 'set next'
		changes the instruction-pointer to the line of code under the cursor
	- 'breakpoint'
		indicates a line where the debugger will halt execution (action is to
		toggle)
		ideas: stop sign, red circle with 'X'
	- 'clear breakpoints'
		ideas: 'go' sign? Like 'breakpoint' but green instead of red?

- misc icons
  - 'sync to folder'
		used in places where the user selects a path to set the path to the
		'working directory' (usually the location of the active document)
		ideas: folder with an arrow pointing into it, e.g.
		       http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-artists&m=116889123829485&q=p3
	- 'find in files'
		ideas: folder with magnifying glass, folder with binnoculars
	- 'new project'
		ideas: window with 'new' sparkle
	- 'open project'
		ideas: window with small folder overlayed
