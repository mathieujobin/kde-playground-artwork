This is a list of icons that are needed by KDevelop, however they vary in
wider applicability. The Oxygen team should make the call as to whether any
particular icon listed here should go in KDevelop's private space or be made
available in the global space. Don't assume that becuase it is listed here,
it needs to be private. :-)

This file is 'refereed' by Matthew Woehlke (mw_triad<AT>users.sourceforge.net).
Please send comments to the lists...
	...from the art/Oxygen side: kde-artists<AT>kde.org
	...from the devel/KDevelop side: kdevelop-devel<AT>kdevelop.org.
I follow both lists and can/will relay as needed.


Legend:
	i	- information (will use a standard icon)
	-	- needs to be drawn
	+	- needs to be drawn (but used only as a base for other icons)
	c	- completed (has been drawn)
	?	- don't draw yet (may not ultimately have an icon)

Icons are listed as '<icon name>' [("<action name, if different>")]
