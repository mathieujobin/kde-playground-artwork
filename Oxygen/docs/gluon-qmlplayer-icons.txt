For the Gluon QML/Touch player to show the game details to the user a few icons can help a
lot to easily identify the actions. For an example see
'http://djszapi.homelinux.net/gluon-game-client.pdf'. (Third page, third view)

This is the list of needed icons at first glance:
1. Highscores (games-highscores exists, thus a simple colour change might be
enough since that orange colour is not the best choice)
2. Achievements
3. Rate & Comment
4. Donate

Note: These actions are more general than Gluon specific meaning that all the
applications using the Open Collaboration Services (for instance over the attica
Qt library) can benefit from this.
