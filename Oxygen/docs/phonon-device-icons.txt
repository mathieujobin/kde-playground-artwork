For Phonon to show a list of audio devices to the user a few icons can help a
lot to easily identify the device. For an example see
'http://vir.homelinux.org/kcmphonon2.png'.

This is the list of possibly needed icons:
1. internal soundcard. perhaps just a pci card
2. external soundcards:
  a) USB
  b) Firewire (does not exist today but will hopefully available in ALSA in the
     future)
  c) Headset (there are headsets that are soundcards themselves, either
     connected via USB or via Bluetooth), perhaps use a headset overlayed with
     either a USB or a Bluetooth logo

probably not used - not yet decided:
3. modem. just a generic modem device icon - in the screenshot I used the old kppp icon
