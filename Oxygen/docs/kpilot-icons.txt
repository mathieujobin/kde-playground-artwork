The icons for KPilot -- an application to synchronize the data on PalmOS
based handhelds and the KDE desktop -- have been a bit of a mess for quite
some time. You can see in the two graphics collections 
          kpilot-actions.png
          kpilot-states.png
that the icons are a mix of Crystal, Kristof Borrey's iKons and my own
crude drawings.

KPilot consists of two applications, which can share an icon: the daemon
and the viewer application.

The daemon has three states which it indicates in the system tray:
not ready, normal mode and busy (which blinks, alternating with the
normal mode icon).

There are five actions that can be done (selected in KPilot, performed
by the daemon, so they show up in app toolbars, app menus and the
context menu of the daemon's tray icon):

hotsync (synchronize data normally). There is a trademarked and highly
	recognizable icon for this in the same colours. The recycle icon
	was once used for this, but that doesn't make much sense.

backup / restore -- binary files copied from or to the handheld.

hhtopc / pctohh -- copy the handheld or PC (KDE) data overtop of the other.
