How to generate all the pngs and the SVGs and the cursor files:

make [-j <n>] [COLOR=<color>]

Where <n> is the number of jobs to run in parallel (man make), and <color> is the color you want generated if you want just one of them.

This is meant to be a developer tool, don't blame on me if the above doesn't work, the
files which will be released, and meant to be used by users will (likely) be just tarballs
containing the cursor files, ready to be installed.

All of what you see here is to be considered a work in progress, and so unreleased.

Write me an e-mail if you need help or additional information.
