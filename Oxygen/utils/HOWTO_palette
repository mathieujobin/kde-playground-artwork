How to have Oxygen palette in Inkscape (0.41 at least): 
Make sure to met the GIMP dependencies.

If you have just granted normal user privileges:

1) in .inkscape make a dir called palettes
2) and then put the oxygen.gpl file in that dir
3) and restart inkscape
4) select the oxygen palette

Better, if you have root access to your machine:

1) put the oxygen.gpl file in /usr/share/inkscape/palettes
2) restart inkscape and select the oxygen palette
