This is a utility that can be used to test a cursor file.
Supported image types are Xcursor files, PNG images, and SVG images.

Usage:
./testcursorfile <svg|png|xcur> [size]

The size argument has no affect with PNG files.

With SVG files, it specifies the size at which the SVG image will
be rendered.

For Xcursor files, the cursor with the size closest to the specified
size will be loaded.

If the size argument is omitted, and the specified file is an SVG
file, the native size of the SVG document will be used.

If the file is an Xcursor file, the optimal size for your monitor
will be computed automatically by the Xcursor library, using the
formula: DPI * 16 / 72
The logic is that the original 16x16 X11 cursors were designed for
72 DPI displays.

Animations are currently only supported for Xcursor files.
For PNG and SVG files, the top-left corner is always used as the
cursor hotspot.

To stop testing the cursor, click anywhere on the screen.

Examples
========

Testing the left_ptr cursor at 32x32:
./testcursorfile left_ptr.svg 32

Testing a generated PNG image:
./testcursorfile left_ptr.png

Testing the size 24 cursor in a generated Xcursor file:
./testcursorfile left_ptr 24
