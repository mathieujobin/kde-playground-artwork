<h2>Recommended color space</h2>

<p>
<a href="base.svg">doc/base.svg</a> contains the recommended color gradients
to be used in the OpenOffice.org CrystalSVG icons. You can open it in <a
    href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and start designing ;)
</p>

<h2>Recommended symbols and indicators</h2>

<p>
Many symbols fit easily for most of actions like <b>ADD</b>, <b>DELETE</b>,
etc. so ideally we should use a different symbol as a standard for each action.
This would hopefully prevent a situation where the same symbol means a lot of
different things.
</p>

<p>
There are more possibilities:
<ul>
    <li>KDE already uses the red circle x for <b>STOP</b> (e.g. in konqueror)
    so we should do the same. Another possibility is a square, which usually
    represents stop on most tape and CD players. Red is associated with stop
    as well.</li>

    <li>For the <b>ADD</b> and <b>DELETE</b>
    icons could be used in a circle or out depending on where it is being used
    to help it stand out if necessary. We prefer the symbol by itself as
    the default; red for the <b>DELETE</b> action, as the black evokes a
    stronger "this is not allowed" or "disabled" feeling.</li>

    <li>For the <b>ERROR</b> red exclamation mark should be used. Red circle x
    (as in <b>STOP</b>) could work here as well to be consistant with the
    indicator in the KDE error message boxes.</li>

    <li>For the <b>LOCKED</b> icon a padlock in or out of a circle seems to be the
    most commonly used for this action.</li>

    <li><b>ADD</b> is pretty much a given. It's usually blue, green, or black;
    we prefer green.</li>

    <li><b>FORBIDDEN</b> is widely indicated with a circle-slash.</li>
</ul>

The recommended choices are highlited in the following image:
