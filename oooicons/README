OpenOffice.org 2.0 KDE (CrystalSVG) icons
=========================================

This directory contains images, scripts and documents to create a good
CrystalSVG icon set for OpenOffice.org 2.0.  The result is intended to be
committed directly to the OpenOffice.org CVS, so the files here must be
covered both under LGPL and SISSL.  ead the COPYING file, it contains text
of both licenses.  If you are interested, you can also see also the licensing
FAQ at http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/faq-licensing.html.

Signing JCA, the Joint Copyright Assignment, is a pre-requisite for the SISSL
license; you can find the form at http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/jca.pdf.
We would not be allowed to upstream the icon set if we did not use the above
mentioned licenses.

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT HERE, IF YOU DID NOT SIGN THE JCA.
