     *             can be empty or null in which case no masking is performed.
     *             However, if present, there should be the same number of

     *                     color is used for all characters in \p text that are
     *                     not altered by \p mask.
     *
     * @param transparent  The character to use to represent transparent areas
     *                     in \p text.  This can be useful when the
     *                     auto-transparency feature can't detect transparent
     *                     areas.
