Some things that come to mind are:

- Shading around tab bars
- Highlighting for: ListView header, slider handle, ScrollBar handle and buttons
- Better isFlat() pushButtons?
- Make disabled state of widgets more obvious
- Check reverse layout
- Scroll Bar:
    - Second subLine button:
        - remove the 1 px line above it
        - remove another pixel between this subLine/addLine so there is no
          line that is 2 px wide between them and they look more like "one" element.
- Progress Bar: Better busy progress indicator
- ListView: Make tree connections lines?
- ToolBar/MenuBar: Add a shading frame around all elements as in the mock up?
  Needs to be CLEAN, otherwise no way.
- MenuBar: Different highlighting/pressed state... renderButton() doesn't seem
  to be the best.
- Round password characters.
- ListView expander/tree connections: Have a look...
- CheckBox/RadioButton: try to paint alphaBlended in khtmlMode
- MouseHover highlighting for "drag" elements (slider, scrollbar thumb...)
- Widget focus indicator: Everything like text input, instead of focusRects?
- Maybe come up with another less minimalistic window decoration design
