The file DB.odt is the data base for renaming icons.

The Type coluumn contains the following:

	FD.o        in the current release 0.8 of the spec

	FD.o-CVS    added in the current draft of the spec available here:

		    http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/default-icon-theme/spec/icon-naming-spec.xml?view=log

		    This is a DocBook XML file which can be converted with: docbook2html

	KDE Only    name will be use only for KDE

	new	    not in the spec which we are requesting be added to the spec

	old         to be use ONLY to rename existing names in older icon themes.

	Tango       is in the Tango renaming XML file but not in the current spec  We need to 
		    determine if we need these icons for KDE.

	IANA        is an offically registered MIME type name.

                    http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/

In the "O" (for Oxygen) column:

	OK          An icon with this name is currently in Oxygen with the correct name.

	->          An icon for this name is currently in Oxygen but something needs to be changed.

There are notes in the right (unlabeled) columns

	rename      An Oxygen icon exists with the name that follows which needs to be changed.
		    As with *NIX, I make no distinction between renaming and moving.

	copy        An Oxygen icon exists with the name that follows which can be copied.

	remove      Icons with that name should be deleted.

        use         The code needs to be changed to use the standard name which follows.

My purpose here is not to rewrite the Icon Naming Spec.  That should be discussed on the XDG mailing list.

Cells marked in bright yellow indicate sepcific issues that need to be decided befor that directory's page can become final.

Cells marked in lite orange are names in the spec which (I think) have issues.  We will use the current name until such time as the spec is changed.
