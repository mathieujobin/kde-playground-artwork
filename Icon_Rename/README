The file DB.odt is the data base for renaming icons.

The Type coluumn contains the following:

	FD.o        The icon name is in the current release 0.8 of the spec

	FD.o-CVS    The icon name is in the current draft of the spec available here:

		    http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/default-icon-theme/spec/icon-naming-spec.xml?view=log

		    This is a DocBook XML file which can be converted with: docbook2html

	KDE Only    This icon name will be use only for KDE

	new	    An icon name not in the spec which we are requesting be added to the spec

	Tango       An icon name which is in the Tango renaming XML file but not in the current 
		    spec  We need to determine if we need these icons for KDE.

In the "O" column:

	OK          An icon with this name is currently in Oxygen with the correct name.

	->          An icon for this name is currently in Oxygen but something needs to be changed.

There are notes in the right (unlabeled) columns

	rename      An Oxygen icon exists with the name that follows which needs to be changed.
		    As with *NIX, I make no distinction between renaming and moving.

	remove      Icons with that name should be deleted.

        use         The code needs to be changed to use the standard name which follows.

My purpose here is not to rewrite the Icon Naming Spec.  That should be discussed on the XDG mailing list.

Cells marked in bright yellow indicat sepcific issues that need to be decided befor that directory's page can become final.

Cells marked in lite orange are names in the spec which have issues.  We will use the current name until such time as the spec is changed.
