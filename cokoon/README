CoKoon is a flexible theme library. It's aims are:
- Combine the advantages of SVG (scalable vector graphics) with layout
  capabilities as known from pixmap theme engines.
- Make it usable in a variety of applications (such as KDE styles,
  KWin decorations, Custom widgets, Application themes...)
- Keep the theme file format simple enough to make future GUI theme editor
  applications possible,
- but powerful enough to be able to achieve tasks which would only have been
  possible with programmatically coded themes previously.

See apidocs for an overview of CoKoon concepts.
