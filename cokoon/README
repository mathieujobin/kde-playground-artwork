CoKoon is a flexible theme library. It's aims are:
- Combine the advantages of SVG (scalable vector graphics) with layout
  capabilities as known from pixmap theme engines.
- Make it usable in a variety of applications (such as KDE styles,
  KWin decorations, Custom widgets, Application themes...)
- Keep the theme file format simple enough to make future GUI theme editor
  applications possible,
- but powerful enough to be able to achieve tasks which would only have been
  possible with programmatically coded themes previously.

See apidocs for an overview of CoKoon concepts.

== Building Cokoon ==
* dependencies:
** KDE 4 development files (Kubuntu: kde4base-dev)
** PyQt bindings and binding generator: (Kubuntu: sip4, python-qt4-dev)

* compile order
*# Cokoon libraries: cokoon/lib (might need to be installed to /usr, otherwise pycokoon can't find the library, at least on my system)
*# Cokoon decoration, widget style: cokoon/decoration, cokoon/style
*# Cokoon Python binding (for PyCokoonEditor): cokoon/PyCokoonEditor/pycokoon
*** $ python configure.py && make && sudo make install
