TODO:
- merge variable- and identifier-map?
- Move more error reporting into the theme parser
- implement all Tile paint modes
- Implementation of Bitmap tile source
  - make it possible to color bitmaps according to expression colors
- Expression: implement 'blend' function
- KWin decoration using cokoon:
  - theme info tags: name, author, description, copyright. in .desktop file
  - default button positions in decoration themes. .desktop file or String Expressions?
- Performance/Memory profiling. Perhaps it will be necessary to
  - Give a QRegion to the ::paint() methods, so only necessary parts of the layout are
    repainted.
  - reduce the number of expression evaluations (track the use of variables/references
    and their old value and only recalculate when they have changed). Perhaps do this
    on a more global level and avoid repeated calculation of layouts...??
  - 'compile' themes into some binary format
  - use KDE's KIconCache
- script for automatic creation of documentation from a given spec XML file
- create dtd's for theme spec and theme description XML formats when they are becoming more stable
