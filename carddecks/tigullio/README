This is a deck of cards I started developing some time ago; I have restarted
after the aKademy 2006, seeing how SVG graphics is finally being used in KDE
games.

The color palette used is:

white
black
red
008000; (dark green)
0080ff; (dark blue/cyan)
88ddff;	(light blue/cyan)
ffee00; (dark yellow)
ffee80; (light yellow)
ffd0d0;	(pink)
